### Windows API Functions
<p>There has always been many ways to write memory to a process, but achieving it is much harder.</p>
<p>We want to strategically read a process memory, and write specifically to the executable portion.</p>
<p>We will use the following to do so.</p>

```c
ReadProcessMemory() && WriteProcessMemory();
```

### Process
<html>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Define the structure of the process we want to read.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Start the process in a suspended state.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Grab the process environment block.</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> Read this structure, grab the base address.</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> Read the next 64 bytes, grab the DOS header.</p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b> Read the DOS header, grab PE header.</p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b> Read PE header, and FINALLY grab <span style="color: red;">address of entry</span>.</p>
<p><b>Step 8.</b> Write our shellcode to the executable portion of code.</p>
<p><b>Step 9.</b> Resume process, clean up.</p>
