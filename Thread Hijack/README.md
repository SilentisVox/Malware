### Windows API Functions

<p>We can leverage the underlying Windows OS with it's own dev tools: Windows API Functions.</p>
<p>We need to find the process, a thread it owns, and instruct the thread to point at code we wrote in the process' address space.</p>
<p>These are the functions to do so.</p>

```c
GetThreadContext() && WriteProcessMemory() && SetThreadContext();
```

### Process

###### We will define strctures on the fly

<p><b>Step 1.</b> Find Process ID of target process.</p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Find Thread ID of thread the process owns.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Open the process.</p>
<p><b>Step 4.</b> Open the thread.</p>
<p><b>Step 5.</b> Suspend target thread.</p>
<p><b>Step 6.</b> Get the thread context.</p>
<p><b>Step 7.</b> Allocate memory to be written to within the target space.</p>
<p><b>Step 8.</b> Write shellcode to allocate memory in target space.</p>
<p><b>Step 9.</b> Set a pointer to the memory for execution.</p>
<p><b>Step 10.</b> Set thread context with pointer to shellcode.</p>
<p><b>Step 11.</b> Resume thread.</p>
